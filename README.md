# Bloomberg BusinessDaily Newsletter Summarizer

## Objective
The goal of this project is to automatically summarize the **Bloomberg BusinessDaily Newsletter** into concise and readable daily summaries. This allows users to quickly understand the key insights from the newsletter without reading the full content.

## Core Components
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Automatically scrape or extract content from the Bloomberg BusinessDaily Newsletter using email parsing techniques.
2. **Text Summarization**: 
   - Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to summarize the newsletter’s content into key insights.
3. **Sentiment Analysis (Optional)**: 
   - Optionally apply sentiment analysis to the newsletter’s sections to gauge the tone of financial markets, companies, or sectors.
4. **Content Delivery**: 
   - Provide the summarized content through various mediums such as email, web display, or downloadable files.

## Development Process

### 1. Data Collection
- **Scraping**: Use web scraping tools like **BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy** to extract the text content of the BusinessDaily Newsletter directly from the Bloomberg website.
- **Email Parsing**: If the newsletter is delivered by email, use Python’s **IMAP** library or other email parsers to retrieve and process the newsletter content.
- **APIs**: Explore using Bloomberg's API (or similar APIs like **NewsAPI**) to pull relevant news content for summarization.

### 2. Text Summarization
- Use pre-trained summarization models like **BART** or **T5** to generate short and accurate summaries of the newsletter content.
- Alternatively, simple extractive summarization models such as **TextRank** or **Gensim** can be used to identify and extract the most important sentences from the text.
- **Customization**: Optionally allow users to prioritize summaries based on topics of interest (e.g., global markets, earnings, M&A activity).

### 3. Sentiment Analysis (Optional)
- Use sentiment analysis tools like **VADER** or advanced models like **RoBERTa** to classify the tone of specific sections of the newsletter (e.g., positive/negative financial outlook).
- Add sentiment scores to the summaries to provide further insight into the market trends discussed.

### 4. Content Delivery
- **Email Delivery**: Set up automated email sending of daily summaries to users' inboxes.
- **Web App**: Develop a simple web interface where users can log in to view the summarized content.
- **CSV Export**: Allow users to export the daily summaries in CSV format for further analysis.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Topic Modeling**: Add automatic classification of newsletter content into different financial topics (e.g., market trends, stock updates, sector performance).
2. **Trend Prediction**: Correlate news content and sentiment with stock market trends or specific company performance.
3. **Personalized Summaries**: Allow users to filter summaries based on preferred topics or companies.
